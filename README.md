- IGANN was renamed to igann_core only because of naming conflicts during the development process. It's like the original IGANN file, but includes IT.

Files:
- igann_core ist igann-it model
- igann_core all changes are marked with # Veitl:
- demo_igann_it is demo of IGANNIT on car insurance use case
- Evaluation_final is evaluation of IGANN-IT model on 12 datasets
- Survey_evaluation_final is evaluation of experimental study

# IGANN-IT Model

This project builds on the original **IGANN model** by *Mathias Kraus* ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MathiasKraus/igann)).

The model has been extended to **IGANN-IT** (Interpretable Generalized Additive Neural Network with Interaction Terms).  

The implementation is provided in the `igann/` package.  
The module `igann_core.py` contains the extended version of IGANN with **interaction terms (IT)**.  
All modifications are marked with `# Veitl:` in the code.
